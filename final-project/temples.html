        <p>Announced in 2002, the Curitiba Brazil Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)
          was completed in early May 2008 and was dedicated June 1 by church president Thomas S. Monson. Located in
          Curitiba, the capital of Paraná state, it became the fifth LDS temple in Brazil.</p>
        <p>The plans to build a temple in Curitiba were announced by the LDS Church on 23 August 2002. Ground was broken
          and the site was dedicated on 10 March 2005 by Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The
          temple serves Latter-day Saints in 21 stakes in the states of Paraná and Santa Catarina.</p>

        <p>The Campinas Brazil Temple, in Campinas, São Paulo, is the 111th operating temple of The Church of Jesus
          Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
        <p>A groundbreaking ceremony and site dedication were held on May 1, 1998. It was presided over by James E.
          Faust a member of the First Presidency, who had served as a missionary in Brazil in the 1940s.</p>
        <p>The temple was open to the public April 20, 2002 through May 11, 2002. Tens of thousands of people were able
          to take a tour through the temple and learn more about its sacred importance. LDS Church president Gordon B.
          Hinckley dedicated the Campinas Brazil Temple on May 17, 2002. Four sessions were held which allowed thousands
          to attend the dedication. Before the dedication, Hinckley met with a large group outside and the final
          cornerstone was placed in the temple. The construction was then officially completed.</p>

        <h3>São Paulo, Brazil Temple</h3>
        <p>The São Paulo Brazil Temple (formerly the São Paulo Temple) is the 19th constructed and 17th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Located in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, it was the first LDS temple built in South America, and also the first temple to use the single story, single spire design. The spire is 101 feet (31 m) tall.</p>
        <p>The intention to construct a temple in São Paulo was announced by the LDS Church on March 1, 1975, with construction beginning twelve months later. Hundreds of local church members gathered to clear the site, which included removing brush, weeds, and banana trees. Hundreds more members donated their time to produce fifty thousand blocks of cast stone composed of quartz, marble chips, and white concrete for the exterior of the temple. It was dedicated on October 30, 1978, by church president Spencer W. Kimball. The temple has two ordinance rooms and four sealing rooms, and has a total floor area of 59,246 square feet (5,504 m²).</p>
        <p>On August 20, 2003, a gold-leafed statue of the angel Moroni was added to the temple during an extensive renovation and enlargement project 25 years after its dedication. Church president Gordon B. Hinckley rededicated the São Paulo Brazil Temple on February 22, 2004.</p>
