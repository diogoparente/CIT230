        <h3>Campinas, Brazil Temple</h3>
        <p>The Campinas Brazil Temple, in Campinas, São Paulo, is the 111th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
        <p>A groundbreaking ceremony and site dedication were held on May 1, 1998. It was presided over by James E. Faust a member of the First Presidency, who had served as a missionary in Brazil in the 1940s.</p>
        <p>The temple was open to the public April 20, 2002 through May 11, 2002. Tens of thousands of people were able to take a tour through the temple and learn more about its sacred importance. LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the Campinas Brazil Temple on May 17, 2002. Four sessions were held which allowed thousands to attend the dedication. Before the dedication, Hinckley met with a large group outside and the final cornerstone was placed in the temple. The construction was then officially completed.</p>
